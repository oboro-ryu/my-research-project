          <p>
            This research evaluates Taiwan's cybersecurity strength by analyzing
            specific cyber incidents through the National Cyber Power Index
            (NCPI) framework. Taiwan, a global hub for semiconductor
            manufacturing, is frequently targeted by state-sponsored
            cyberattacks, primarily from China, North Korea, and Russia. These
            attacks range from foreign intelligence collection to critical
            infrastructure sabotage. By assessing Taiwan’s cyber power in
            relation to over 20 nations using NCPI’s Cyber Intent Index (CII)
            and Cyber Capability Index (CCI), this study quantifies Taiwan’s
            resilience against cyber threats. The results indicate that while
            Taiwan demonstrates moderate resilience, critical vulnerabilities
            remain in defending its commercial technology sector and countering
            advanced persistent threats (APT).

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
          The advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has dramatically transformed modern life, enabling seamless communication, vast information access, and the digitization of essential services. Governments and militaries around the world have increasingly integrated these technologies into their operations, improving efficiency and bolstering national security measures. Many governments now rely on digital platforms for tasks such as tax filing, digital infrastructure management, and public services, while militaries use ICTs for command-and-control operations, intelligence gathering, and strategic decision-making.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">1.1 Background</h3>
          <p>
          Despite these advantages, the widespread adoption of ICTs has also introduced significant vulnerabilities. Cyber threats such as hacking, data breaches, and cyberattacks now pose considerable risks to national security, as they compromise sensitive information, disrupt critical infrastructure, and destabilize economies. Cyberattacks have the potential to undermine trust in public institutions, threaten democratic systems, and weaken economic stability. These risks have prompted nations to develop comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) to strengthen their defenses against adversarial state and non-state actors.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">1.2 Research Objectives</h3>
          <p>
          The goal of this research is to evaluate Taiwan’s cybersecurity strength by analyzing specific cyber incidents and mapping them to the National Cyber Power Index (NCPI) framework.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">2.1 Cybersecurity Challenges in Taiwan</h3>
          <p>
          Taiwan's unique geopolitical position places it at the center of regional tensions, with cyberattacks playing a key role in shaping the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region. Various studies have analyzed how cyberattacks are used in modern warfare to destabilize economies, gather intelligence, and compromise military capabilities. However, Taiwan’s specific challenges remain underrepresented in global cybersecurity studies, which often focus on the US, China, and Japan.
Recent reports suggest that Chinese cyber operations are intensifying, particularly in targeting Taiwan’s critical infrastructure and intellectual property. As the global leader in semiconductor production, Taiwan’s IT sector has become a key target for state-sponsored cyberattacks seeking to disrupt production or steal valuable technological advancements. Furthermore, Taiwan’s reliance on digital systems for governance and public services increases its vulnerability to attacks aimed at disrupting essential services. For instance, the 2021 attack on Taiwan’s healthcare system caused widespread disruptions, highlighting the fragility of its digital infrastructure in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.

          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">2.2 Theoretical Framework</h3>
          <p>
          Theoretical frameworks related to cyber operations often include. theories of cyber deterrence, cyber power, and information warfare. These theories explore how states use cyber capabilities to achieve strategic objectives, influence adversaries, and protect national interests.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">2.3 Previous Research</h3>
          <p>
          Previous studies have investigated various aspects of cyber. operations, such as their role in modern warfare, the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures, and the implications of cyber threats on national security. However, gaps remain in understanding how different nations employ cyber strategies and their comprehensive impact on geopolitical stability. This research aims to address these gaps by providing a comparative analysis of cyber operations across multiple nations.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">3.1 National Cyber Power Index Framework</h3>
          <p>
            The National Cyber Power Index (NCPI) provides a comprehensive framework to assess a country’s cyber capabilities. It categorizes cyber power into eight strategic objectives:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Surveilling and Monitoring Domestic Groups:</strong> The ability to surveil and monitor citizens and domestic entities for intelligence purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strengthening and Enhancing National Cyber Defenses:</strong> Defending against cyberattacks, particularly those targeting critical infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Controlling and Manipulating the Information Environment:</strong> Influencing or controlling information flows within and outside the country.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Foreign Intelligence Collection for National Security:</strong> Gathering intelligence from foreign actors through cyber means.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growing National Cyber and Commercial Technology Competence:</strong> Developing commercial cyber technologies and growing digital infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Destroying or Disabling an Adversary’s Infrastructure:</strong> Cyberattacks aimed at disabling or destroying foreign critical infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Defining International Cyber Norms:</strong> Setting global cyber standards and norms to influence international cyber governance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Amassing Wealth and Extracting Cryptocurrency:</strong> Engaging in cyber activities aimed at acquiring wealth, including cryptocurrency theft.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Each cyber incident in this study is evaluated based on its relevance to one or more of these objectives, assigning weighted scores to measure the overall impact on Taiwan’s national cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">3.2 Incident-Based Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            To measure the severity of each incident, two indices are applied:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Cyber Capability Index (CCI):</strong> Measures the technical capability of the cyber operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cyber Intent Index (CII):</strong> Measures the intent and strategic impact of the operation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Both CCI and CII are rated on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents maximum impact. Each incident is mapped to the NCPI objectives, and the final score is calculated by aggregating the weighted impacts of each incident across multiple objectives.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">3.3 Data Sources</h3>
          <p>
            The data for this study comes from two primary sources:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>112年度國家資通安全情勢報告:</strong> A comprehensive report on Taiwan’s cybersecurity incidents and threats, documenting key cyber events affecting Taiwan in recent years.

          {/* 3.4 Justification for the Selected Index and Consideration of Alternatives */}
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">3.4 Justification for the Selected Index and Consideration of Alternatives</h3>
          <p>
            In this study, the National Cyber Power Index (NCPI) was selected as the primary analytical framework for several key reasons.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Firstly, NCPI is uniquely positioned to evaluate cyber power through eight national objectives—including surveillance and monitoring, strengthening national cyber defenses, information manipulation, foreign intelligence collection, growth in cyber and commercial technology competence, destruction or disabling of adversarial infrastructure, defining international cyber norms, and amassing wealth or extracting cryptocurrency. These objectives comprehensively cover the diverse aspects of modern cyber strategies, making NCPI the most suitable for the research aims, particularly in assessing military cyber capabilities.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Other indices, such as the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM) and the Cyber Readiness Index (CRI), were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate for this study. These indices focus primarily on cybersecurity maturity and preparedness, which, while valuable, do not provide a holistic assessment of a nation’s cyber power. Specifically, they lack sufficient emphasis on military cyber capabilities and offensive operations, making them less relevant for the comparative analysis of Japan, the United States, China, and Taiwan in the context of the Taiwan situation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) was also evaluated as a potential framework. However, GCI is primarily concerned with assessing internal cybersecurity resilience and defense measures, and it does not adequately address the multifaceted nature of cyber power. GCI's exclusion of key indicators related to military cyber operations, intelligence gathering, and offensive capabilities limits its applicability to this study, which requires a more comprehensive evaluation of national cyber power.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The Cyber Capabilities and National Power (CCNP) index was recognized for its qualitative assessment of national cyber ecosystems. However, the absence of a scoring or ranking system renders it unsuitable for the quantitative comparative analysis pursued in this research. While CCNP provides a valuable qualitative analysis of a nation’s cyber capabilities, it does not focus on specific national objectives as NCPI does, which is crucial for this study's objectives.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Given these considerations, NCPI was determined to be the most appropriate framework for this research. Its ability to comprehensively evaluate the cyber power of Japan, the United States, China, and Taiwan, particularly in relation to military capabilities, makes it the optimal choice for the comparative analysis of national cyber strategies in the context of the Taiwan situation.
